# Vidly-TS - Movie Rental Plataform

# Objectives

The main objective of this project is to convert an APP built using React-Javascript-Bootstrap to an APP using React-Typescript-SCSS. The idea is to generate unnexpected challanges on the conversion, focusing on the tecnologies istead of the bussiness rules and solutions that will be delivered.

**From:**

- React 16 (using mount/dimount)
- Javascript (no types)
- Bootstrap 5 (built in styles)

**To:**

- React 17 (using useEffect, useState)
- Typescript (hard typed)
- css, scss ([https://sass-lang.com/guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide))

## What was archieve so far

The challanges were really present. Many research had to be done to convert from react 16 to react 17. Using useState and useEffect with objects comparsion imposed a good challange, because they become different every time a render occur.
